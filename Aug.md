- #### Know your target before sending out the email

  #### Today I sent out emails to a person who should not be fully responsible to the tasks I mentioned, and I should know better before sending it.
  
  #### 正确的方式是: Try to confirm and clarify the responsible person, otherwise you just bring extra effort to irrelvant person, and it's high possiblity to be denied by them.

  
  > *This is what I learn: Check again before sending emails.*
