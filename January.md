### Mr.T asked:"hey can you fix a permissions issue in gitlab set up Ms.A as a developer in the component-library and mark me as a maintainer?"

### I said:" I’m not the owner, as developer role same as you, I don’t think I can make you as maintainer, I think you should ask IT, but I can add Ms.A as developer".

#### (The moment I was thinking, why can't you add Ali as developer? I got same role as you, but I didn't ask, I thought okay, if you want me to help, I will help, no problem, btw, Mr.T reports to me)

-------------

### A few minutes later, Mr.T asked again:" Also can you do the same for Mr.M?"
 

#### (I started to feel something, curious and a bit annoyed)
### so I reply:" You can’t invite him? I thought we have the same permission"
### Mr.T:"no i can't invite anyone".

### My boss did something I'm not appreciate, and when I talking to him, I accidentally express some of my feeling, I said:"maybe next Monday we could .....".

#### (This is not approperiate, because saying something couldn't affect current is useless, and this expression gives bad impression to my boss)

> *This is what I learn: Keep silience when you're angry, keep it for a while, and let the angry feeling vanish, then do what you should do, the angry will affect your decision and your behaviors *
